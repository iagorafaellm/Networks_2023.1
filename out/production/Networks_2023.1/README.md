# Basic server-client program: Word translation through message passing

## Description:
In this project, we implement a basic word translator.
It is composed of two main classes: 
- TCPServer implements a server that handle clients requests for the translation of words.
- TCPClient implements a client that asks its user for input, sends the respective request for translation to the server and prints the result.
